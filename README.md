# Dummies GUI

This program provides a simple GUI to easily use the dummies during the Optical Communications tests.

## Requirements

To use the program, you need to have installed the following requirements:

- Python 3.6 or higher
- PySimpleGUI 4.70.1
- Tkinter 8.6 

## How to use

In this repository, you will find two main python files: `emisor.py` and `receptor.py`. Each file is responsible for the GUI of the transmitter and receiver dummies, respectively.

To run each of the dummies programs, you need to execute the following commands in the terminal of the respective dummies (or in the same computer but different terminals while testing):

   * Transmitter Dummy:
   ```bash
   python emisor.py
   ```
   
   * Receiver Dummy:
   ```bash
   python receptor.py
   ```
